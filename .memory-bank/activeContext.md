# Active Context: Gravy Work AI Skills Assessment Platform
*Version: 1.0*
*Created: $(date)*
*Last Updated: $(date)*
*Current RIPER Mode: EXECUTE*

## Current Focus
Successfully implemented core AI Skills Assessment POC components using real GravyWork assessment criteria. All foundational code is complete with assessment templates, Bedrock prompts, Twilio integration, and Lambda handlers. Ready for audio production and final deployment.

## Template State Assessment

### Template Foundation (‚úÖ Available):
- **Infrastructure Stack**: S3, SQS, DynamoDB, Lambda framework established
- **Configuration System**: `project.config.ts` for centralized project settings
- **Deployment Pipeline**: SST v3 with dev/staging/production stages
- **Development Environment**: VS Code devcontainer with Python 3.12 and Node.js
- **Basic LLM Integration**: `llm_config.py` and `bedrock_service.py` foundation exists

### Template Characteristics:
- **Generic Nature**: Currently configured for general AWS serverless applications
- **Configuration-Driven**: All project-specific settings flow through `project.config.ts`
- **Stage-Aware**: Different behavior for dev/staging/production deployments
- **DevContainer Ready**: Includes AWS CLI, Python, Node.js development tools

## Files Safe to Customize vs. Preserve

### üõ†Ô∏è SAFE TO CUSTOMIZE:
- **`project.config.ts`**: Primary configuration file - modify for voice and AI services
- **`functions/src/handlers/index.py`**: Main Lambda handler - customize for assessment logic
- **`functions/src/config/llm_config.py`**: LLM configuration - extend for assessment prompts
- **`requirements.txt`**: Runtime dependencies - add AI/voice service libraries
- **`requirements-dev.txt`**: Development dependencies - add testing tools
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation

### üö´ PRESERVE TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:
- **`infra/infrastructure.ts`**: Keep generic, config-driven infrastructure
- **`infra/application.ts`**: Preserve Lambda and S3 trigger patterns
- **`sst.config.ts`**: SST framework configuration
- **`init-new-project.sh`**: Project initialization script
- **`.cursorrules`**: Template guidelines and rules

## Recent Changes
- **EXECUTE Phase Completed**: Successfully implemented all core POC components
- **Assessment Templates**: Created real GravyWork evaluation criteria for all 3 roles (30+ questions)
- **Bedrock Integration**: Implemented assessment prompts using exact GravyWork standards
- **Lambda Handlers**: Complete assessment webhook handler with routing and analysis logic  
- **Infrastructure**: Added API Gateway for Twilio webhooks with proper permissions
- **Testing Suite**: All components tested and working correctly
- **Audio Scripts**: Generated 30 professional scripts ready for voice recording

## Active Decisions

### Voice Service Provider:
- **Status**: DECIDED ‚úÖ - Twilio selected for built-in STT capabilities
- **Rationale**: Eliminates need for AWS Transcribe, simpler integration, proven reliability
- **Implementation**: Use `<Gather speech="true">` for automatic STT during calls

### Assessment Architecture:
- **Status**: SIMPLIFIED ‚úÖ - Single handler pattern for POC
- **Approach**: One `assessment_handler.py` with direct API calls (no service layer)
- **Data Storage**: S3 JSON files instead of complex database schemas
- **Pre-recorded Questions**: Static audio files stored in S3, no TTS needed

### Language Support:
- **Status**: DEFERRED ‚úÖ - English-only for Phase 1 POC
- **Phase 2 Addition**: Spanish support will be added after core functionality proven
- **Simplified Implementation**: No language detection complexity for initial POC

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1-2 - Phase 1):
1. **Configure Voice Service Integration**: Choose and implement AWS Connect or Twilio
2. **Extend Lambda Handlers**: Add assessment_handler.py, voice_handler.py modules
3. **Set Up LLM Assessment Logic**: Extend existing Bedrock integration for skills evaluation
4. **Create DynamoDB Schema**: Add WorkerSkillAssessments, SkillTemplates, CallSessions tables
5. **Build Basic Assessment Flow**: End-to-end test with 1-2 priority skills (English only)

### Near-term (Week 3 - Phase 2):
1. **Implement Bilingual Support**: Spanish language integration for Transcribe/Polly
2. **Add Resume Generation**: Service to create structured resumes from assessment data
3. **Multi-skill Assessment**: Logic to assess multiple related skills in single call
4. **Gravy Work Integration**: API endpoints for existing platform communication

### Medium-term (Week 4 - Phase 3):
1. **Full Skill Template Coverage**: Expand from 3-5 skills to broader assessment capability
2. **Enhanced Compliance**: Audit trails, bias prevention, call recording management
3. **Performance Optimization**: Concurrent call handling, response time improvement
4. **Production Deployment**: Staging validation and production readiness

## Current Challenges

### Technical Integration:
- **Real-time Voice Processing**: Achieving sub-second response times for natural conversation
- **Bilingual Switching**: Seamless language detection and response generation
- **Assessment Accuracy**: Balancing thoroughness with 3-5 minute call duration limit

### Template Extension:
- **Preserve Generic Nature**: Adding AI capabilities while maintaining template reusability
- **Configuration Complexity**: Managing voice service, AI service, and bilingual settings
- **Infrastructure Scaling**: Voice service capacity planning and cost optimization

### Business Integration:
- **Existing Platform APIs**: Understanding Gravy Work's current worker management system
- **Compliance Requirements**: EEOC guidelines, call recording consent, bias prevention
- **Skills Definition**: Translating job requirements into assessable conversation flows

## Implementation Progress

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Core POC):
- [‚úì] Real GravyWork assessment templates with exact evaluation criteria
- [‚úì] Bedrock prompts using official GravyWork standards from Atlassian wiki
- [‚úì] Complete assessment handler with Twilio webhook routing
