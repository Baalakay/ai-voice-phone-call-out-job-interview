# Active Context: Gravy Work AI Skills Assessment Platform
*Version: 2.0*
*Created: $(date)*
*Last Updated: January 2025*
*Current RIPER Mode: EXECUTE*

## Current Focus
‚úÖ **FULLY OPERATIONAL AI SKILLS ASSESSMENT SYSTEM** - Complete end-to-end voice assessment platform with multi-role support, ElevenLabs professional voice integration, advanced Twilio call flow controls, and S3-hosted web UI. System successfully handles 10+ questions per role with sophisticated timeout handling, question repeats, and state management. Current focus: Twilio account management and scaling considerations.

## Template State Assessment

### Template Foundation (‚úÖ Available):
- **Infrastructure Stack**: S3, SQS, DynamoDB, Lambda framework established
- **Configuration System**: `project.config.ts` for centralized project settings
- **Deployment Pipeline**: SST v3 with dev/staging/production stages
- **Development Environment**: VS Code devcontainer with Python 3.12 and Node.js
- **Basic LLM Integration**: `llm_config.py` and `bedrock_service.py` foundation exists

### Template Characteristics:
- **Generic Nature**: Currently configured for general AWS serverless applications
- **Configuration-Driven**: All project-specific settings flow through `project.config.ts`
- **Stage-Aware**: Different behavior for dev/staging/production deployments
- **DevContainer Ready**: Includes AWS CLI, Python, Node.js development tools

## Files Safe to Customize vs. Preserve

### üõ†Ô∏è SAFE TO CUSTOMIZE:
- **`project.config.ts`**: Primary configuration file - modify for voice and AI services
- **`functions/src/handlers/index.py`**: Main Lambda handler - customize for assessment logic
- **`functions/src/config/llm_config.py`**: LLM configuration - extend for assessment prompts
- **`requirements.txt`**: Runtime dependencies - add AI/voice service libraries
- **`requirements-dev.txt`**: Development dependencies - add testing tools
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation

### üö´ PRESERVE TEMPLATE STRUCTURE:
- **`infra/infrastructure.ts`**: Keep generic, config-driven infrastructure
- **`infra/application.ts`**: Preserve Lambda and S3 trigger patterns
- **`sst.config.ts`**: SST framework configuration
- **`init-new-project.sh`**: Project initialization script
- **`.cursorrules`**: Template guidelines and rules

## Recent Changes
- **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE**: Fully functional AI skills assessment system deployed and operational
- **ElevenLabs Integration**: Professional "Rachel" voice used throughout all 31 audio files for consistent experience
- **Advanced Call Flow**: Implemented star (*) key question repeat, pound (#) answer submission, 5-second timeout handling
- **Web UI Deployed**: S3-hosted interface with role selection, phone persistence (default: 234-555-6789), call initiation
- **Multi-Role Support**: Bartender, Banquet Server, Host with 10+ questions each, including split glassware questions
- **State Management**: Robust Lambda-based session handling with proper recording and transcription processing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive Twilio trial account guidance and phone verification instructions

## Active Decisions

### Voice Service Provider:
- **Status**: DECIDED ‚úÖ - Twilio selected for built-in STT capabilities
- **Rationale**: Eliminates need for AWS Transcribe, simpler integration, proven reliability
- **Implementation**: Use `<Gather speech="true">` for automatic STT during calls

### Assessment Architecture:
- **Status**: SIMPLIFIED ‚úÖ - Single handler pattern for POC
- **Approach**: One `assessment_handler.py` with direct API calls (no service layer)
- **Data Storage**: S3 JSON files instead of complex database schemas
- **Pre-recorded Questions**: Static audio files stored in S3, no TTS needed

### Language Support:
- **Status**: DEFERRED ‚úÖ - English-only for Phase 1 POC
- **Phase 2 Addition**: Spanish support will be added after core functionality proven
- **Simplified Implementation**: No language detection complexity for initial POC

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Operational Phase):
1. **Twilio Account Management**: Switch to paid account or different Twilio account for unrestricted calling
2. **Phone Number Verification**: Manage verified caller ID list for trial account limitations
3. **Scale Testing**: Validate concurrent call capacity and system performance under load
4. **Analytics Integration**: Add call success metrics and assessment quality tracking
5. **User Training**: Document system usage for Gravy Work team onboarding

### Near-term (Enhancement Phase):
1. **Advanced Analytics**: Assessment result analysis, success rate tracking, quality metrics
2. **Additional Roles**: Expand beyond current 3 roles to cover more hospitality positions
3. **Question Refinement**: Optimize questions based on real-world assessment performance
4. **Integration Improvements**: Enhanced Gravy Work platform API connectivity
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time system health and call quality monitoring

### Medium-term (Scale Phase):
1. **Multi-Language Support**: Spanish language integration for broader candidate reach
2. **Advanced Features**: Scheduling system, callback functionality, assessment reminders
3. **Compliance Enhancement**: EEOC compliance monitoring, bias prevention measures
4. **Geographic Expansion**: Support for different regions and phone number formats
5. **Enterprise Features**: Multi-tenant support, custom branding, advanced reporting

## Current Challenges

### Technical Integration:
- **Real-time Voice Processing**: Achieving sub-second response times for natural conversation
- **Bilingual Switching**: Seamless language detection and response generation
- **Assessment Accuracy**: Balancing thoroughness with 3-5 minute call duration limit

### Template Extension:
- **Preserve Generic Nature**: Adding AI capabilities while maintaining template reusability
- **Configuration Complexity**: Managing voice service, AI service, and bilingual settings
- **Infrastructure Scaling**: Voice service capacity planning and cost optimization

### Business Integration:
- **Existing Platform APIs**: Understanding Gravy Work's current worker management system
- **Compliance Requirements**: EEOC guidelines, call recording consent, bias prevention
- **Skills Definition**: Translating job requirements into assessable conversation flows
