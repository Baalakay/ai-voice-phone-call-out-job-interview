*Last Updated: $(date)*

## Project Overview
Gravy Work is building an AI Voice-Based Skills Assessment POC to replace their current "Willow" video interview system. This platform will conduct automated phone interviews for hospitality and service job skills, reducing the 60% candidate drop-off rate and improving worker onboarding conversion.

## Core Requirements
- **Automated Phone Interviews**: AI calls workers for 3-5 minute skill assessments
- **Multi-Skill Assessment**: Single call can assess multiple related skills  
- **Bilingual Support**: English and Spanish language capability
- **Resume Generation**: Automatically capture and structure work history
- **Skills Hierarchy**: Auto-approve related skills based on qualifications
- **Integration**: Seamless connection with existing Gravy Work worker platform

## Business Problem Statement
### Current "Willow" System Issues:
- **60% candidate drop-off rate** due to poor user experience with video interviews
- **High barrier to entry** requiring upfront completion of video assessments, background checks, I-9 verification
- **Manual processing bottleneck** for high-volume skill assessments
- **Competitive disadvantage** - competitors have simpler onboarding flows

### Business Impact:
- Reduced worker acquisition and retention
- Increased cost per successful onboarding  
- Operational inefficiency in skill verification
- Poor user experience affecting brand perception

## Assessment Categories

### High-Priority Skills (Customer-Facing/High-Risk):
- **Bartender** - Drink knowledge, customer service, certification verification
- **Host/Hostess** - Communication skills, English proficiency, customer interaction
- **Grill Cook** - Food safety, cooking techniques, English for order communication
- **Line Cook** - Professional kitchen experience, teamwork, food preparation

### High-Volume Skills:
- **Banquet Server** - Service experience, event coordination
- **Food Runner** - Restaurant operations, communication skills

## Technical Assessment Requirements

### 1. Technical Skill Competency
- Job-specific knowledge verification
- Experience validation through structured questioning  
- Practical scenario-based assessment

### 2. English Language Proficiency
- **Customer-facing positions**: Conversational English required
- **Kitchen/back-of-house**: Basic communication sufficient
- **Assessment approach**: Conduct interview in English for qualifying roles
- **Fallback**: Support Spanish-speaking candidates for non-customer-facing roles

### 3. Work History Capture
- Structured collection of previous relevant experience
- Automatic resume generation from interview responses
- Employment verification data collection

### 4. Certification Verification
- State-specific requirements (TIPS alcohol service, food handling)
- Document upload integration for certification proof
- Binary qualification flags for compliant roles

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs:
- **Conversion Rate Improvement** - Reduce drop-off from 60% baseline
- **Time to Skill Approval** - Reduce from current manual process time
- **Assessment Accuracy** - Validate skill predictions against job performance
- **User Satisfaction** - Worker experience ratings improvement

### Secondary Metrics:
- **Cost per Assessment** - Operational efficiency vs manual screening
- **Scalability** - Volume capacity compared to current bottlenecks
- **Compliance** - Audit trail and bias prevention measures

## Scope

### In Scope - POC Deliverables:
- **Phase 1**: Core Voice Assessment for 3-5 priority skills with English language assessment
- **Phase 2**: Enhanced features including bilingual support and multi-skill assessment
- **Phase 3**: Production readiness with full skill coverage and analytics

### Out of Scope - Future Phases:
- Full skill set coverage (30+ skills) beyond POC
- Advanced scheduling and notification system
- Comprehensive analytics and optimization platform
- Integration with hiring pipeline beyond skill assessment

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Week 1-2 - Core Assessment Engine
- **Phase 2**: Week 3 - Enhanced Features  
- **Phase 3**: Week 4 - Production Polish
- **Total POC Duration**: 4 weeks

## Stakeholders
- **Primary Stakeholder**: Bobby Sherwood, Gravy Work
- **Technical Partner**: Extension/Blake McDonald (AI/ML Implementation)
- **End Users**: Hospitality workers applying for gig work positions

## Business Value Proposition
1. **Improved Worker Acquisition** - Lower barrier to entry increases conversion rates
2. **Operational Efficiency** - Automated assessment reduces manual processing
3. **Better User Experience** - Convenient phone-based vs video interview system
4. **Competitive Advantage** - Match or exceed competitor onboarding simplicity
5. **Scalability** - Handle volume growth without proportional staff increases
6. **Data Quality** - Structured collection improves matching and performance tracking
