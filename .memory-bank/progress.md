## Current System Architecture (September 2025)

### âœ… Core Components:
- **Twilio Voice API**: Outbound calling with advanced call flow controls
- **AWS Lambda Functions**: 
  - `webhook_simple.py`: Handles call flow, question progression, recording management
  - `assessment_processor_simple.py`: Post-call LLM analysis with AWS Transcribe and Claude Sonnet 3
- **AWS S3**: Audio file storage, web UI hosting, assessment results storage
- **AWS Transcribe**: Speech-to-text conversion for candidate responses
- **Amazon Bedrock (Claude Sonnet 3)**: LLM analysis with detailed scoring and reasoning
- **ElevenLabs API**: Professional voice generation (Rachel voice)

### âœ… Assessment Flow:
1. **Web UI**: User selects role and initiates call
2. **Twilio Call**: Outbound call with professional intro and instructions
3. **Question Flow**: Sequential questions with star (*) repeat and pound (#) submit
4. **Recording**: Each response recorded and stored in S3
5. **Transcription**: AWS Transcribe converts speech to text
6. **LLM Analysis**: Claude Sonnet 3 evaluates responses with 0-10 scoring
7. **Results Dashboard**: Comprehensive UI with original questions, responses, and analysis

### âœ… Scoring System:
- **Three Categories**: Baseline Criteria, Experience & Responsibilities, Knowledge Checks
- **0-10 Point Scale**: Ideal (10), Acceptable (7), Red Flag (3), No Response (0)
- **PASS/REVIEW/FAIL Logic**: Based on 70% threshold across categories
- **Detailed Reasoning**: AI provides specific explanations for each score

## Known Issues

### Template Integration Considerations:
- **Preserve Template Nature**: MEDIUM SEVERITY - Must maintain generic, configurable structure while adding specialized AI capabilities
- **Configuration Complexity**: LOW SEVERITY - Managing voice service, AI service, and bilingual settings in `project.config.ts`
- **Resource Naming**: LOW SEVERITY - Ensure all new resources follow template naming conventions

### Technical Challenges:
- **Real-time Voice Latency**: HIGH SEVERITY - Sub-second response times required for natural conversation flow
- **Bilingual Language Detection**: MEDIUM SEVERITY - Accurate and fast language identification for proper service routing  
- **Assessment Accuracy**: HIGH SEVERITY - Balancing comprehensive evaluation with 3-5 minute call duration constraint

### Integration Risks:
- **Gravy Work API Documentation**: MEDIUM SEVERITY - Need comprehensive API documentation for seamless integration
- **Voice Service Capacity**: MEDIUM SEVERITY - Unknown concurrent call limits and scaling behavior
- **Compliance Requirements**: HIGH SEVERITY - EEOC guidelines, state regulations, bias prevention measures

- **Configuration Extended**: Adding voice service and AI service sections to `project.config.ts`
- **Handler Customization**: Extending generic handler with assessment-specific logic
- **Resource Additions**: Voice service components added while preserving template patterns

### Template Best Practices Maintained:
- **Configuration-Driven**: No hardcoded values in infrastructure files
- **Stage-Aware**: Different settings for dev/staging/production
- **Resource Naming**: Using template helper functions for consistent naming
- **Modular Structure**: Following template's service/handler/model organization
