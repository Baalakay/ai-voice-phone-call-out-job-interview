,Do you have protocols for handling right-to-be-forgotten or data deletion requests?,Evaluates readiness for managing consumer privacy rights that may affect model training data.,"S3 lifecycle policies and deletion capabilities support data removal requests; no model retraining required due to foundation model approach.","Candidate data can be completely removed from system while preserving anonymized performance metrics."
,What audit trails or logging requirements apply to your AI system?,Identifies logging and traceability requirements..,"Complete audit trail from call initiation through final assessment results; CloudTrail logs all AWS service interactions.","Comprehensive logging enables compliance reporting and system debugging for regulatory requirements."
,,,,
Security Considerations,Have you established data classification levels for information processed by the AI system?,Assesses maturity of data security categorization that will affect access controls.,"PII (candidate phone numbers, responses) classified as sensitive; assessment templates as internal; results as confidential.","Data classification drives access controls, encryption requirements, and retention policies."
,What authentication and authorization mechanisms are required for your GenAI application?,Identifies security controls needed for user access management.,,"Would integrate with customer's existing identity management systems (SSO, Active Directory, etc.)."
,Do you have requirements for encryption of data at rest and in transit?,Determines security protocols needed for data protection throughout the AI pipeline.,"All data encrypted at rest (S3 AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+); AWS managed encryption keys with option for customer-managed keys.","End-to-end encryption from Twilio call recording through final assessment storage."
,Have you conducted a threat modeling exercise for the proposed GenAI application?,Assesses proactive security planning and risk identification.,,"Formal threat modeling would be conducted during enterprise security review with customer's security team."
,What content moderation or filtering requirements exist?,Identifies safety mechanisms needed for user-facing content.,"Assessment questions are pre-defined and professional; candidate responses analyzed for job relevance rather than content moderation.","Structured interview format minimizes inappropriate content risks compared to open-ended AI interactions."
,,,,
Enterprise Integration,What existing systems will the GenAI application need to integrate with?,Maps integration points that will require API development or connectors.,,"Would integrate with customer's ATS (Applicant Tracking System), HRIS platforms, and scheduling systems as needed."
,Do you have existing single sign-on (SSO) or identity management systems to leverage?,Identifies authentication integration requirements for seamless user experience.,,"System designed to integrate with common SSO providers (SAML, OAuth, Active Directory, etc.)."
,What APIs or service endpoints are available for integration with your current systems?,Evaluates available technical connection points for enterprise integration.,"RESTful API endpoints for assessment initiation, status checking, and results retrieval; webhook support for real-time updates.","Standard API patterns enable integration with popular HR platforms and custom systems."
,Are there specific data exchange formats required for compatibility with your systems?,Identifies format requirements for input/output compatibility.,"JSON for structured data exchange, CSV for bulk exports, PDF for human-readable reports; flexible format support.","API supports multiple output formats to accommodate different system requirements."
,What latency or performance requirements exist for integrations?,Establishes performance expectations for integrated operations.,"API response times <500ms for status queries; assessment results available within 10 minutes of call completion.","Real-time webhooks provide immediate status updates for integrated systems."
,,,,
Governance & Risk Management,Who are the key stakeholders responsible for AI governance and compliance?,Identifies key stakeholders and decision-makers for compliance matters.,,"Would be defined by customer organization - typically HR leadership, Legal/Compliance, and IT Security teams."
,What monitoring and reporting processes are needed for AI system oversight?,Determines operational governance requirements for ongoing supervision.,"Automated monitoring of assessment quality metrics, bias detection reports, and performance dashboards with configurable alerting.","System provides comprehensive reporting for compliance audits and continuous improvement."
,What are your thresholds and criteria for human review of AI outputs?,Identifies when human intervention is required in AI processes.,,"Customer-defined thresholds for edge cases, low confidence scores, or disputed assessments requiring human review."
,What change management processes apply to AI model updates or system changes?,Evaluates controls for managing system evolution while maintaining compliance.,,"Would follow customer's existing change management procedures with additional AI-specific testing and validation requirements."
,How will you monitor for and address model drift or performance degradation?,Identifies ongoing quality management approaches for long-term stability.,"Continuous monitoring of assessment score distributions, correlation with hiring outcomes, and transcript quality metrics.","Automated alerts for significant performance changes with escalation procedures for investigation."
,What is your organization's approach to managing bias in AI systems?,Assesses awareness and mitigation strategies for AI fairness issues.,"Regular bias audits across demographic groups, diverse assessment criteria design, and transparent scoring methodology.","Proactive bias detection with corrective action protocols and stakeholder reporting."
,Have you conducted a risk assessment specific to this GenAI implementation?,Determines if formal risk evaluation has been performed for the use case.,,"Formal risk assessment would be conducted during implementation planning with customer's risk management team."
,,,,
Legal and Licensing,Have you reviewed licensing terms for all models and data sources you plan to use?,Ensures awareness of legal usage constraints for third-party components.,"AWS Bedrock Claude usage complies with Amazon's service terms; ElevenLabs TTS licensed for commercial use; Twilio services under standard terms.","All third-party services used under appropriate commercial licenses with clear usage rights."
,What intellectual property considerations apply to AI-generated content?,Clarifies ownership and rights related to system outputs.,"Assessment results and analysis belong to the customer organization; no proprietary model training or IP creation involved.","System generates evaluation reports rather than creative content, minimizing IP complexity."
