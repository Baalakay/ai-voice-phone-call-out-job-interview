# GravyWork AI Skills Assessment - POC Role Definitions

*Source: [GravyWork Skill Assessment Templates](https://gravywork.atlassian.net/wiki/x/CQB-Nw)*

## POC Scope: Three Roles

For the **Proof of Concept**, we will implement AI screening for these three roles:

1. **Banquet Server / Food Runner**
2. **Bartender** 
3. **Host**

These roles represent common hospitality entry points and cover both **guest-facing** (English required) and **support/multi-language** contexts.

## Assessment Structure (All Roles)

Each role follows a consistent 4-part structure:

### A. Experience & Responsibilities (Credibility Check)
- **Purpose**: Verify real-world experience
- **Time**: 2-4 minutes
- **Format**: 3-part questions about workplace, timeframe, and duties

### B. Knowledge Checks  
- **Purpose**: Test role-specific technical knowledge
- **Time**: 3-5 minutes
- **Format**: 4-5 targeted questions with ideal/acceptable/red flag answers

### C. English Communication Component
- **Purpose**: Verify guest interaction capability (role-dependent)
- **Time**: 2-3 minutes  
- **Format**: Scenario-based questions

### D. Admin Review
- **Purpose**: Flag borderline answers for human review
- **Format**: AI identifies uncertain responses for manual evaluation
