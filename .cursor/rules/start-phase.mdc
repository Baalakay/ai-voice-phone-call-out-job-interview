# CursorRIPER Framework - START Phase
# Version 1.0.1

## AI PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS
This file defines the START phase component of the CursorRIPER Framework. As an AI assistant, you MUST:
- Load this file when PROJECT_PHASE is "UNINITIATED" or "INITIALIZING"
- Guide the user through project initialization in a step-by-step manner
- Create all required memory bank files with proper formatting
- Update state.mdc as each step is completed
- Archive this component once initialization is complete

## START PHASE OVERVIEW

The START phase is a one-time preprocessing phase that runs at the beginning of a new project or major component. It focuses on project initialization, scaffolding, and setting up the Memory Bank with baseline information.

```

## START PHASE PROCESS

[PHASE: START]
- **Purpose**: Project initialization and scaffolding
- **Permitted**: Requirements gathering, technology selection, architecture definition, project structure setup
- **Entry Point**: User command "BEGIN START PHASE" or "/start"
- **Exit Point**: Automatic transition to RESEARCH mode after setup is complete

## STEP-BY-STEP INITIALIZATION

### Step 0:  Check of /prd folder is populated
- If `/.prd` folder contents are empty then halt this process, and reply back to the user informing them to add the required project requirements documents in the /prd folder, then run `/start` again."

### Step 1: Memory Bank Initialization

- Read project requirements documentation first:
  - `/.prd` folder contents - All project requirements documentation including template-specific domain knowledge, requirements, and comprehensive documentation
- Create and populate all core memory files intelligently distributing content:
  - projectbrief.md - Extract project overview, requirements, scope from sources
  - systemPatterns.md - Extract architecture, design patterns, technical decisions
  - techContext.md - Extract technology stack, development setup, constraints
  - activeContext.md - Current template state and next steps
  - progress.md - Template completion status and known capabilities
- **Key Actions**:
  - **STEP 1.1**: Read and parse all files in `/.prd` folder (project requirements documentation)
  - **STEP 1.2**: Extract and categorize content by memory file type
  - **STEP 1.3**: Create memory-bank directory structure
  - **STEP 1.4**: Populate memory files with synthesized content from sources
  - **STEP 1.5**: Document current template state in activeContext.md
  - **STEP 1.6**: Set up progress.md reflecting template's current capabilities
- **Output**: Complete memory bank with template-aware content distribution

## SOURCE DOCUMENT CONTENT DISTRIBUTION

When reading files from `/.prd` folder, distribute content as follows:

### Content for projectbrief.md
- Project overview and purpose statements
- Core requirements and success criteria  
- Project scope (in/out of scope items)
- Template philosophy and design principles
- Stakeholder information (template users, AI agents, etc.)

### Content for systemPatterns.md  
- Template architecture descriptions
- Infrastructure + Application stack patterns
- Central configuration system design
- Resource naming conventions and helper functions
- Stage-aware deployment patterns
- Design decisions and their rationales

### Content for techContext.md
- Technology stack details (SST, Python, AWS services)
- Development environment setup instructions
- Dependencies and package management approach  
- SST-specific implementation notes
- Technical constraints and limitations
- Build and deployment procedures

### Content for activeContext.md
- Current template state and capabilities
- Recent changes and updates
- Files safe to customize vs. preserve
- Common usage patterns and workflows

### Content for progress.md
- Template features that are completed
- Known capabilities and functionality
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Integration points and extension opportunities

## TRANSITION TO RIPER WORKFLOW

Once all six steps are completed:
1. Verify all memory files are properly created and populated
2. Update state.mdc with:
   - PROJECT_PHASE = "DEVELOPMENT"
   - START_PHASE_STATUS = "COMPLETED"
   - START_PHASE_STEP = 6
   - INITIALIZATION_DATE = [current date/time]
3. Archive this component to .cursor/rules/archive/start-phase.mdc.archive
4. Automatically transition to RESEARCH mode
5. Inform the user: "Project initialization complete. Entering RESEARCH mode to begin development."

## DELIVERABLES CHECKLIST

At the end of the START phase, ensure the following are complete:

- [ ] **Project requirements documentation read**: All files in `/.prd` folder parsed
- [ ] **Content distributed intelligently**: Source content categorized by memory file type  
- [ ] Project requirements documented in projectbrief.md (using source content)
- [ ] Technology stack selected and documented in techContext.md (using source content)
- [ ] System architecture defined in systemPatterns.md (using source content)
- [ ] Project scaffold created (if applicable for template projects)
- [ ] Development environment configured and documented
- [ ] Memory Bank initialized with all core files using template-aware content
- [ ] Current template state documented in activeContext.md
- [ ] Template capabilities documented in progress.md

Once all items are checked, the system will automatically transition to the RIPER workflow.
