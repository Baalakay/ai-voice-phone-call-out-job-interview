## Project Overview

Gravy Work is developing an AI-powered voice assessment platform to replace their current video-based worker onboarding system. The platform will conduct automated phone interviews to assess hospitality workers' skills, reducing the current 60% candidate drop-off rate and eliminating manual processing bottlenecks.

The solution uses AI voice agents to conduct 3-5 minute bilingual (English/Spanish) phone assessments, automatically generating worker resumes and skill qualifications for the gig work/staffing platform.

## Core Requirements

- **Automated Voice Assessment System**: AI agents conduct phone-based skills interviews
- **Bilingual Support**: English and Spanish language capability for inclusive assessment  
- **Multi-Skill Evaluation**: Single call can assess multiple related hospitality skills
- **Resume Generation**: Automatically capture and structure work history from interviews
- **Skills Hierarchy Logic**: Auto-approve related skills based on demonstrated qualifications
- **Integration**: Seamless connection with existing Gravy Work worker platform
- **Real-time Processing**: Immediate assessment results and skill approval workflow
- **Compliance & Audit**: Full recording retention and bias prevention measures

## Success Criteria

- **Reduce Drop-off Rate**: Improve from 60% baseline through lower-friction onboarding
- **Assessment Accuracy**: Validate skill predictions against actual job performance
- **Processing Speed**: Faster time-to-skill-approval vs current manual process
- **User Satisfaction**: Higher worker experience ratings compared to video interviews
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduce cost per assessment vs manual screening operations
- **Scalability**: Handle volume growth without proportional staffing increases

## Scope

### In Scope
- Core voice calling infrastructure and AI conversation management
- Skills assessment for 6 high-priority hospitality roles (bartender, host/hostess, grill cook, line cook, banquet server, food runner)
- English language proficiency evaluation for customer-facing positions
- Work history capture and automated resume generation
- Integration with existing worker profile and skill application systems
- Compliance features for audit trails and bias prevention

### Out of Scope
- Complete replacement of existing background check and I-9 verification systems
- Full skill set coverage beyond priority roles (30+ skills reserved for Phase 3)
- Advanced scheduling optimization and notification systems
- Integration with third-party job boards or external staffing platforms

## Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Core assessment engine with basic voice calling and 3 priority skills
- **Week 3**: Enhanced features including bilingual support and resume generation  
- **Week 4**: Production polish with full priority skills and performance optimization
- **Total Duration**: 4-week POC development with AWS integration

## Stakeholders

- **Primary Stakeholder**: Bobby Sherwood, Gravy Work (Business Owner)
- **Technical Partner**: Extension/Blake McDonald (AI/ML Implementation Lead)
- **End Users**: Hospitality workers applying for gig work positions
- **Operations Team**: Gravy Work staff managing worker onboarding and compliance
