# Progress Tracker: Gravy Work AI Skills Assessment Platform
*Version: 1.0*
*Created: 2025-01-26*
*Last Updated: 2025-01-26*

## Project Status
Overall Completion: 15%

## What Works (Existing Template Capabilities)

- **Infrastructure Foundation**: 100% - S3 bucket, SQS queue, DynamoDB table provisioning with SST
- **Lambda Function Framework**: 100% - Python 3.12 runtime with proper AWS service permissions
- **Configuration System**: 100% - Central config in project.config.ts with helper functions for consistent naming
- **Stage Management**: 100% - Environment-specific deployment (dev/staging/production) with appropriate protection
- **Development Environment**: 100% - VS Code devcontainer with Python/Node.js tooling
- **Basic AWS Integrations**: 100% - S3 event triggers, SQS message processing, DynamoDB operations
- **Existing LLM Integration**: 80% - Bedrock service foundation exists but needs conversation management

## What's In Progress

- **Memory Bank Setup**: 95% - CursorRIPER framework initialized, all memory files created
- **Requirements Analysis**: 100% - Project goals and technical specifications documented
- **Architecture Planning**: 60% - Base template assessed, AI extensions identified

## What's Left To Build

### Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Core Assessment Engine
- **Voice Calling Infrastructure**: HIGH - AWS Connect or Twilio integration for outbound calls
- **Speech Services Setup**: HIGH - Amazon Transcribe real-time + Amazon Polly multilingual
- **Assessment Orchestrator**: HIGH - Lambda handler for complete assessment lifecycle management
- **LLM Conversation Engine**: HIGH - Bedrock integration with prompt templates and response parsing
- **Basic Skills Templates**: HIGH - Assessment questions and criteria for 3 priority hospitality skills
- **Worker Integration**: HIGH - APIs to connect with existing Gravy Work worker profile system

### Phase 2 (Week 3): Enhanced Features  
- **Bilingual Support**: MEDIUM - Language detection and Spanish conversation templates
- **Resume Generation**: MEDIUM - Automatic work history capture and resume formatting
- **Multi-Skill Assessment**: MEDIUM - Single call handling multiple related skills evaluation
- **Advanced Scoring**: MEDIUM - Skills hierarchy logic and cross-skill recommendations

### Phase 3 (Week 4): Production Polish
- **Extended Skill Coverage**: LOW - Assessment templates for all 6 priority hospitality roles
- **Compliance Features**: MEDIUM - Audit trails, bias prevention monitoring, recording retention
- **Performance Optimization**: MEDIUM - Response time optimization for real-time voice interaction
- **Comprehensive Testing**: HIGH - Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing with actual voice calls

## Known Issues

- **Voice Service Selection**: HIGH - AWS Connect vs Twilio decision needed with feature comparison
- **Real-Time Performance**: MEDIUM - LLM response times may exceed 200ms threshold for natural conversation
- **Template Preservation**: LOW - Risk of over-customizing generic template and losing reusability

## Milestones

- **Memory Bank Complete**: 2025-01-26 - COMPLETED
- **Voice Service Integration**: 2025-01-28 - PENDING
- **Basic Assessment Flow**: 2025-02-02 - PENDING  
- **Bilingual Support**: 2025-02-09 - PENDING
- **POC Completion**: 2025-02-16 - PENDING

## Template-Specific Progress

### SST Template Capabilities Utilized:
- [✓] **Central Configuration System**: project.config.ts being used for all project-specific settings
- [✓] **Infrastructure Stack Pattern**: S3 + SQS + DynamoDB foundation preserved
- [✓] **Lambda Handler Framework**: Python function structure ready for assessment logic
- [✓] **Stage-Aware Deployment**: Development vs production environments configured
- [✓] **Helper Functions**: Resource naming conventions maintained

### Template Extensions Required:
- [ ] **Voice Calling Components**: New infrastructure for AWS Connect/Twilio
- [ ] **AI Service Integration**: Extend existing Bedrock setup for conversation management
- [ ] **Database Schema**: Add assessment tracking and skills template tables
- [ ] **API Gateway**: WebSocket support for real-time call management
- [ ] **Enhanced Permissions**: Lambda roles for voice services and additional AWS resources
